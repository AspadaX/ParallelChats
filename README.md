# ParallelChats
a macOS app that allows multithread chats with LLM

## What's for?
As a programmer, it is convenient to just ask the LLM to learn new concepts 
and knowledge. However, when chatting with LLMs, it is usually not avoidable 
to jump back and forth between different topics. While the existing UIs for 
LLM conversations are great, but I did not find a good candidate that allows 
for multithread chats all at the same time. 

For this reason, I created this app to make multithread chats possible, although
it is just a small app which has no other fancy functionalities. 

The app allows users to open multiple windows when chatting to the LLM. So it 
is great for jumping back and forth between different topics. 

## How to use this?
1. Download the zip file from the `Release` section. 
2. Unzip. Then, drag and drop the app to the `Application` folder. 
3. Open and enjoy!

**Note**
You may need to setup your own API credentials and connections in the `Settings` by hitting `CMD + ,`. 

To start a new window/thread, hit `CMD + N`. Or, you may click the `+` button to start a new tab.
